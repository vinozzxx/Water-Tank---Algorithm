# 💧 Water Tank Problem – Vanilla JavaScript Web App

A simple **frontend web application** that visualizes and calculates how much **rainwater is trapped between blocks** of different heights. This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** and follows the classic **Water Tank (Trapping Rain Water) problem**.

---

## 📌 Project Need / Purpose

In many real‑world and technical interview scenarios, we need to **analyze elevation data** and calculate how much water can be stored between structures.

This project helps to:

* Understand **array-based problem solving**
* Apply **logic and mathematical reasoning** visually
* Practice **DOM manipulation** using Vanilla JavaScript
* Demonstrate frontend skills for **interview assignments**

The app visually represents blocks and trapped water, making the logic **easy to understand**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an array of non‑negative integers representing block heights, compute how many **units of water** are trapped between the blocks after raining.

### Example

```
Input  : [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 4, 0]
Output : 18 Units
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the application
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core logic & visualization
* **SVG / Div-based blocks** – Water tank representation

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User provides an **array of block heights**
2. JavaScript calculates:

   * Left maximum height
   * Right maximum height
3. Water trapped at each position is calculated using:

```
water = min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i]
```

4. Total trapped water is displayed
5. Blocks and water are **visually rendered**
